                        Balancing my work life and my personal life is esencial for my mental health and my ability to effective do my job.
                        Being outside is something that brings me peace and helps me get away from any stress that I have in my life.
                        My hobbies are skateboarding, fishing, photography, hiking, camping, and hanging out with my friends.
                        All of these things have shaped me to be the person I am and I believe that they have been the most important times of my life.
                        At work I've enjoyed the opportunity to build relationships with my coworkers and help each other with things inside and outside
                        of work.
